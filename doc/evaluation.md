# Evaluation

### Stress Testing

As the highlight of this project is the application of distributed architecture to deal with high concurrency scenarios. 
Stress testing tools like Jmeter will be used to simulate high QPS(Queries Per Second) and generate reports to reflect the 
compressive capacity of the application and the estimated bearing capacity of the application.


### Unit Tests
In this project, unit tests are implemented to test the DAO of the application, i.e.Perform database operations. The DAO is the key point of the application because
most user interactions result in data being sent to or retrieved from database, so it is necessary that they are thoroughly tested.

### User Testing

Testers will test each functional interface. The final version of this project will be deployed on cloud server that can be accessed by testers.

This evaluation was undertaken based off feedback from the form provided to
testers, this feedback was separate from their bug reports and focused on their
opinions of the app. Test users were selected from within and outside of the course,
